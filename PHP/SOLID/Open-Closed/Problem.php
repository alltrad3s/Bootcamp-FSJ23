        Concept: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, 
        but closed for modification.

        Real-World Analogy: Think of a graphic design software. It allows you to add new 
        functionalities (like new shapes) without changing the core drawing engine.

        In Practice: Implementing new functionalities via interfaces or abstract classes, 
        allowing new functionalities to be added without changing existing code.

        Example: To follow the Open/Closed Principle, we can use abstract classes and 
        inheritance to add new payment types without changing existing code:
